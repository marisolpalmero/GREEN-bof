# Name: Getting Ready for Energy-Efficient Networking (GREEN)
## Description 

As the desire to improve energy efficiency gains momentum, network operators increasingly focus on understanding energy consumption by different links, nodes, and devices/components within their networks. Network Energy-efficiency management involves deploying and managing network infrastructures with the goals of optimizing energy use on network devices while improving network utilization. This will involve technologies to monitor energy consumption, evaluate the effectiveness of energy saving polices, use control strategies to improve energy efficiency in network operations.

This BoF is intended to discuss these objectives and determine whether there is a community of interest to work on these topics within the IETF through a new working group (provisionally called GREEN).

The BoF discussion should identify a suite of short-term deliverables aimed at enhancing energy efficiency within networks. Key objectives include standardizing terms and definitions for energy metrics, and YANG models for reporting energy consumption usage and performing energy management. Additionally, the group could create a applicability statement to describe the effective collection and utilization of these metrics and attributes. The proposed approach is to tackle energy efficiency challenges in a systematic and incremental manner, focusing on practical building blocks that contribute to overarching energy efficiency goals.
