# Name: Getting Ready for Energy-Efficient Networking (GREEN)
## Description 

As the desire to improve energy efficiency gains momentum, network operators increasingly focus on understanding energy consumption by different links, nodes, and devices within their networks. Energy-aware networking encompasses deploying and managing network infrastructures to reduce energy consumption, optimize energy efficiency, and minimize environmental impact. This will involve technologies to monitor energy consumption, evaluate the effectiveness of energy saving polices, use control strategies to improve energy efficiency, and foster sustainability in network operations.

This BoF is intended to discuss these objectives and determine whether there is a community of interest to work on these topics within the IETF through a new working group (provisionally called GREEN).

This working group would develop a suite of short-term deliverables aimed at enhancing energy efficiency within networks. Key objectives include standardizing terms and definitions for energy metrics, reporting energy consumption usage at different levels in the network via YANG models, and providing YANG RPCs for better energy management. Additionally, the group could create a framework to describe the effective collection and utilization of these metrics and attributes. The proposed approach is to tackle energy efficiency challenges in a systematic and incremental manner, focusing on practical building blocks that contribute to overarching energy efficiency goals.
